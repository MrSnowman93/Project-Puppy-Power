<h4 class="tot-author">By Mr-Borin and Martman</h4>
<p class="tot-paragraph1">
  The time is finally here for the Puppy Power Tales of Tribute tournament to begin! All members of Puppy Power are invited to take part – there are no requirements in order to sign up, only an enthusiasm to play. The dates of the tournament are shown below. Just say in here or message me if you would like to join.I have allowed a week for sign-ups to take place, if you know of anyone not on discord who might be interested, please let them know.This will be followed by a random matching of players. Players must then make time to play during each week specified. We all know how some matches can go so each pairing will play 3 matches and the winner will be best of 3. I will only publish who has won in order to save anyone who might lose 2-0 any potential embarrassment. I have made a little ToT house with a table to play should players wish to get in the zone. Semi-finals and the final match will be hosted here. I will make it my primary residence for all players to visit and play should they wish to do so. If matches are not played within the allotted time, then both of these players are knocked out of the round. If a player disconnects or goes offline during a match, then the match is won by the other player. This is to prevent players quitting during a match and then claiming it was a D/C.

</p>
<p class="tot-paragraph2" >
  The Orgnum patron is not to be selected and played within the Tournament.
In order to verify a win, including as a result of a D/C, screenshots of the matches should be sent to myself.
The Tournament winner will take home a hefty 300,000 Gold Prize!
Second place will receive a 150,000 Gold Prize!
Third place will receive a 50,000 Gold Prize!
Don’t be shy, get involved, and best of luck to you all!
